# NEIGHBORhood Karaoke Helper

A RESTful API that switches in the word 'NEIGHBOR', replacing instances of the n-word in song lyrics.

This API uses Express and the Genius API through [genius-lyrics-api](https://github.com/farshed/genius-lyrics-api) npm package.

## Description

</br>

This API offers a simple alternative to using the n-word in song.

Using your favorite REST client hit the below endpoints to search for a song and/or return lyrics that have been specifically altered to improve potentially unfortunate choices. Doing better really is so easy.

Inspired by this author's unlucky karaoke-night shifts behind the bar in a Texas college town, and by the below tweet:

[!["y'all want permission to say the n-word because it's in the lyrics but will change the pronouns in a love song so you don't sound gay"
